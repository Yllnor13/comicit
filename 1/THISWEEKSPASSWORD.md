## this weeks password requierment

the input file is a series of numbers in seemingly random order. You are not required to sort them.
The task for you today is to split up the even and odd numbers, and then list up the second digits in the order that they appear in the list. The first part of the password is the second digit of all the even numbers, followed by the second digit of all the odd numbers. There are no spaces or commas or any other symbols in the password besides the numbers

my solution will also be included inside the zipped file

good luck
